# MM-TSFlib
MM-TSFlib is an open-source library for multimodal time-series forecasting based on [Time-MMD](https://github.com/AdityaLab/Time-MMD/) dataset. We achieve multimodal time series forecasting tasks, including both short-term and long-term, by integrating time series models and language models. Our framework is illustrated in the figure.

:triangular_flag_on_post:**News** (2024.06)  Preprocessing functions and preprocessed data to speed up the training process will be released soon

 
## Usage

1. Install environment, execute the following command.

```
pip install -r environment.txt
```

2. Prepare Data. Our dataset is [Time-MMD](https://github.com/AdityaLab/Time-MMD/) dataset.
We provide preprocessed data in the ./data folder to accelerate training, particularly simplifying the text matching process.

2. Prepare for ClosedSource LLM. Our framework is already capable of integrating closed-source LLMs. To save costs, you should first use closed-source LLMs, such as GPT-3.5, to generate text-based predictions. We have provided specific preprocessing methods in the [[document/file](https://github.com/AdityaLab/MM-TSFlib/tree/main/data/DataPre_ClosedSourceLLM)].

3. Prepare for open-source LLMs. Our framework currently supports models such as LLAMA2, LLAMA3, GPT2, BERT, GPT2M, GPT2L, and GPT2XL, all available on Hugging Face. Please ensure you have your own Hugging Face token ready.

4. Train and evaluate model. We provide the example experiment script under the folder `./scripts/`. You can reproduce the experiment results as the following examples:

```
#Conduct experiments on the health dataset using GPU 0, and utilize the 0th to 1st models.
bash ./scripts/week_health.sh.sh 0 1 0
```
-You can set a list of model names, prediction lengths, and random seeds in the script for batch experiments. We recommend specifying `--save_name` to better organize and save the results.
